This project is part of submission for the [Boomi V/S Bufficorn: NFT Battle ](https://covalenthq.notion.site/Boomi-vs-Bufficorn-NFT-Battle-Workshop-w-Covalent-ETHDenver-2687bc5431d3420a9ccac9ac75256db6) organised by [CovalentHQ](https://www.covalenthq.com/) at [ETHDenver,2022](https://twitter.com/EthereumDenver)

### Project Description
We have created a Pokémon card styled NFT Battle Gallery which uses the Covalent API to get a random Boomi and Bufficorn NFT and compare their attributes before they go into Battle.

Note: Everytime the website reloads, it shows a random paof Boomi and Bufficorn NFT.

### Some behind the scenes

This project was built right from ideation to a live version in less than 15hrs (Our timezone didn't let us take the advantage of the full 24hrs :p). Here are some images of scribbling a rough design and the final MVP.

#### Step1: Always draw a rough design

Further works (Future Versions):
- A functionality to select the NFT Collection that you want to have a battle for instead of just Boomi and Bufficorn
- An actual game like Street Fighter where the NFTs fight. Can be implemented in python itself.
- Give a strength score of the two NFTs by using either a statistical or Machine Learning model taking parameters such as Transactions, floor price, attributes, rarity etc into account


We had a lot of fun building this ❤️
Covalent API is amazing!
